# PhasmoWheel

Program(s) that call an array of items to be used to choose one object that can be utilized.

This project was inspired by a Phasmophobia "Challenge Mode" in which survivors are only allowed to enter the area with zero items, and subsequently only allowed to bring in additional tools that are chosen at random each time the ghost hunts. This increases the difficulty in identifying the ghost, as some tools are a specific requirement in determining the ghost type.

While this is not a requirement, this adds an increased difficulty in the game for veteran ghost hunters.

This project is an un-official game addition for players and Twitch Streamers that are looking for an additional challenge to add to the game. Please check out and support the original game/developer of Phasmophobia here https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/
